# Data Platform Strategy: SATS/WFS Strategic Sourcing AI Agent

## 1.1 Executive Summary

**Business Context**: SATS/WFS procurement faces significant latency in strategic sourcing due to manual data gathering and analysis, limiting capacity and opportunity realization.
**Strategic Vision**: We will build an "Analysis-First" Data Platform on Azure that acts as an intelligent bridge between internal ERPs (SAP/D365) and external market intelligence, enabling an AI Agent to accelerate sourcing decisions.
**Expected Outcomes**: Reduction of sourcing cycle time from weeks to minutes, increased team capacity, and data-driven negotiation leverage.
**Strategic Bets**:

1. **Agentic AI over Traditional BI**: Focusing on an active AI agent that synthesizes data rather than just passive dashboards.
2. **Analysis-First Integration**: Prioritizing read-only aggregation of insights before attempting complex transactional write-backs to ERPs.

## 1.2 Business Requirements & Strategic Response

**REQ-001: Drastic Reduction in Sourcing Cycle Time (Weeks -> Minutes)**

- **Strategic Approach**: Pre-integrate and cache market data and supplier intelligence to allow instant, on-demand analysis via the AI Agent.
- **Key Capabilities**: Real-time (or near real-time) API connectors, High-performance data serving layer, NLP engine for document parsing.
- **Success Criteria**: Analysis generation time < 5 minutes per request.
- **Dependencies**: Availability of external market data APIs.
- **Strategic Rationale**: Pre-processing and caching data shifts the latency from the "user wait time" to system background capabilities.

**REQ-002: Global Scalability & Compliance (Singapore -> Global)**

- **Strategic Approach**: Design a region-agnostic data model with strict tenancy controls to respect local data privacy (GDPR, etc.) while running on a unified Azure infrastructure.
- **Key Capabilities**: Row-level security (RLS), Data Residency configuration, Multilingual NLP.
- **Success Criteria**: Seamless rollout to US/Europe without re-platforming.
- **Dependencies**: Azure region availability, Legal clearance.
- **Strategic Rationale**: A unified platform with logical separation constitutes a lower TCO than fragmented regional deployments.

**REQ-003: "Analysis-Only" Autonomy (No Autopilot)**

- **Strategic Approach**: Implement a "Human-in-the-Loop" workflow architecture where the AI proposes, and the Human approves.
- **Key Capabilities**: Workflow state management, Approval gates, Audit logging of all AI suggestions vs. Human decisions.
- **Success Criteria**: 0% unauthorized transactions; 100% trace of decision lineage.
- **Dependencies**: Identity Management (Azure AD) integration.
- **Strategic Rationale**: Mitigates critical operational risk while building trust in the AI system.

## 1.3 Data Platform Strategy

- **Data Architecture Pattern**: **Lakehouse (Azure)**.
  - *Rationale*: Combines the flexibility of raw file storage for unstructured supplier documents (PDFs, contracts) with the structured performance of a warehouse for financial data.
- **Data Storage Strategy**:
  - **Raw Zone (Data Lake)**: Store original API responses and documents. Critical for audit and AI model re-training.
  - **Curated Zone (SQL/Delta)**: Modeled supplier entities, material masters, and price histories.
  - **Knowledge Graph Zone**: Store relationships between suppliers, categories, and risks to power the AI Agent's reasoning.
- **Data Integration Approach**: **Hybrid Batch + On-Demand**.
  - *Strategy*: Use scheduled batch (daily) for stable master data (SAP/D365). Use on-demand API calls for volatile external market data during a sourcing event.
- **Data Modeling Approach**: **Entity-Centric**.
  - *Focus*: Master 'Supplier', 'Item', and 'MarketRate' entities to enable 360-degree views.
- **Data Quality Strategy**: **Gatekeeper Pattern**.
  - *Mechanism*: Validate external data schema and confidence scores before allowing it into the "Curated" zone. Flag low-confidence AI parsings for human review.
- **Data Lineage & Observability**: **End-to-End Tracing**.
  - *Mechanism*: Tag every insight generated by the Agent with source document IDs (e.g., "Price recommendation based on Bloomberg Index X and Supplier Quote Y").
- **Security & Governance**: **Zero Trust & Confidential Computing**.
  - *Mechanism*: Azure Key Vault for API secrets. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for seeing sensitive pricing data.

## 1.4 Technology Approach (High-Level)

- **Cloud Platform**: **Microsoft Azure**
  - *Rationale*: Aligns with SATS/WFS enterprise standard (D365 implies MSFT stack); strong enterprise AI security features.
- **Core Platform Capabilities**:
  - **Storage**: ADLS Gen2.
  - **Compute**: Azure Functions (Serverless) for lightweight API fetchers; Azure Synapse or Databricks for heavy AI processing.
  - **AI/ML**: Azure OpenAI Service (for the Agent LLM), Azure AI Search (for document RAG).
- **Integration**:
  - **Internal**: Azure Data Factory for SAP/D365 batch loads.
  - **External**: Python-based API connectors running on Azure Functions.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: **Terraform**
  - *Rationale*: Standardization, drift detection, and existing team preference.

## 1.5 Strategic Decisions

### Decision D-001: AI interaction Model

**Decision Point**: How does the AI access data?
**Options**:

1. **Pre-training/Fine-tuning**: Bake knowledge into the model.
2. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Fetch relevant data dynamically.
**Recommended Strategy**: **RAG**.
**Rationale**: Sourcing data (prices, risks) changes daily. Re-training is too slow. RAG ensures the agent sees the latest data and can cite sources (critical for trust).

### Decision D-002: ERP Integration Depth

**Decision Point**: How tight should the coupling with SAP/D365 be in Phase 1?
**Options**:

1. **Direct Database Access**: Read directly from ERP DB.
2. **API/Export Interface**: Consume standard reports/APIs.
**Recommended Strategy**: **API/Export Interface**.
**Rationale**: Reduces vendor lock-in details and avoids performance impact on critical transactional systems. Faster implementation for Pilot.

# Business Case: Strategic Sourcing AI Agent

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the business case for deploying an **AI-powered Buyer Agent** to transform the strategic sourcing process at SATS/WFS. The initiative aims to dramatically improve the speed and quality of sourcing analysis by leveraging internal and external data sources, starting with a pilot for **Airport Services "Non-Food" categories in Singapore**.

## Problem Statement

Current strategic sourcing processes are manual and time-consuming, often taking weeks to complete comprehensive market analysis. This latency limits the purchasing team's capacity and agility, particularly in resource-constrained regions, potentially leading to missed savings opportunities and suboptimal sourcing decisions.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the AI Buyer Agent project are:

1. **Speed**: Reduce sourcing cycle time from **weeks to minutes**.
2. **Capacity**: Increase the purchasing team's capacity to handle more categories and strategic initiatives.
3. **Innovation**: Foster innovation through advanced data connectivity and comprehensive market analytics.
4. **Compliance**: Enhance compliance and risk reduction via standardized, AI-driven processes.

## Scope

### Initial Pilot Phase

- **Categories**: Airport Services "Non-Food" categories.
- **Region**: Singapore Hub.
- **Functionality**: **Analysis-only**. The AI Agent will generate sourcing recommendations and market analysis but will **not** perform direct supplier negotiation or PO placement.

### Future Expansion

- Extend to "Food" and "Commodity" categories.
- Rollout to European and USA regions.
- Potential integration for RFQ automation and PO placement (post-pilot validation).

## Operating Model

- **User Interaction**: Procurement staff interact with the agent via a **Web Portal**.
- **Workflow**:
    1. User inputs product/service specs, location, and target volume/price.
    2. AI Agent analyzes internal/external data.
    3. **Human Oversight**: Managers review AI outputs, validate sources, and approve recommendations before any action is taken.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Success will be measured against the following metrics:

- **Cycle Time**: Reduction in time required for sourcing analysis (target: minutes vs. weeks).
- **Financial Impact**: Additional value and savings generated through better market insights.
- **Quality**: Relevance and accuracy of sourcing recommendations.

## Timeline

| Phase | Governance | Date |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Requirement Gathering / RFQ** | | Nov 2025 – Mar 2026 |
| **Development** | | April – June 2026 |
| **Testing** | | July – Sept 2026 |
| **Training** | | Oct – Dec 2026 |
| **Go Live** | | Jan 2027 |

## ROI & Benefits

- **Operational Efficiency**: Massive reduction in manual data gathering and analysis efforts.
- **Strategic Focus**: Frees up buyers to focus on high-value negotiations and supplier relationships.
- **Better Decisions**: Data-driven recommendations reduce bias and improve sourcing outcomes.
